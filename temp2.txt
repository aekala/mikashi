						<p id="songLyricsDiv"  class="songLyricsV14 iComment-text">You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge<br />
<br />
[Verse One: Ice Cube]<br />
<br />
Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube<br />
From the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes<br />
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off<br />
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off<br />
You too, boy, if ya fuck with me<br />
The police are gonna hafta come and get me<br />
Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out<br />
For the punk motherfuckers that's showin out<br />
Niggaz start to mumble, they wanna rumble<br />
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo<br />
Goin off on a motherfucker like that<br />
with a gat that's pointed at yo ass<br />
So give it up smooth<br />
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move<br />
Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin<br />
with a crime record like Charles Manson<br />
AK-47 is the tool<br />
Don't make me act the motherfuckin fool<br />
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe<br />
I'm knockin niggaz out tha box, daily<br />
yo weekly, monthly and yearly<br />
until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly<br />
that I'm down with the capital C-P-T<br />
Boy you can't fuck with me<br />
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck<br />
Coz Ice Cube is crazy as fuck<br />
As I leave, believe I'm stompin<br />
but when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton<br />
<br />
[Chorus:]<br />
<br />
(City of Compton, City of Compton)<br />
<br />
[Eazy E] Yo Ren<br />
[MC Ren] Whassup?<br />
[Eazy E] Tell em where you from!<br />
<br />
[Verse Two: MC Ren]<br />
<br />
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga<br />
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger<br />
I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this<br />
But the pussy ass niggaz don't show this<br />
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps<br />
If not from the records, from jackin the crops<br />
Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'<br />
And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'<br />
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute<br />
I find a good piece o' pussy, I go up in it<br />
So if you're at a show in the front row<br />
I'm a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho<br />
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to<br />
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to<br />
a crazy muthafucker from tha street<br />
Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up shit<br />
MC Ren controls the automatic<br />
For any dumb muthafucker that starts static<br />
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself <br />
every time I pull a AK off the shelf <br />
The security is maximum and that's a law<br />
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw<br />
See, coz I'm the motherfuckin villain<br />
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin<br />
that's takin place without a clue<br />
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through<br />
Look, you might take it as a trip<br />
but a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip<br />
Straight outta Compton...<br />
<br />
[Chorus:]<br />
<br />
(City of Compton, City of Compton)<br />
<br />
[Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin...<br />
<br />
[Verse Three: Eazy-E]<br />
<br />
...straight outta Compton<br />
is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother<br />
and make ya sister think I love her<br />
Dangerous motherfucker raises hell<br />
And if I ever get caught I make bail<br />
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem<br />
I see a motherfuckin cop I don't dodge him<br />
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while<br />
And when I see a punk pass, I smile<br />
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a nigga drivin<br />
but don't know where the fuck he's going, just rollin<br />
lookin for the one they call Eazy<br />
But here's a flash, they never seize me<br />
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark<br />
except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation<br />
and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration<br />
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin<br />
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin<br />
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!<br />
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!<br />
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me<br />
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother<br />
word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton<br />
<br />
[Chorus:]<br />
<br />
(City of Compton, City of Compton)<br />
<br />
