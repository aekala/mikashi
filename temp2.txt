Parmesan where my accountant lives<br />
In fact, I'm downin’ this<br />
D'USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts<br />
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub<br />
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?<br />
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras<br />
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris<br />
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk<br />
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk<br />
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk<br />
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk<br />
My left stroke just went viral<br />
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral<br />
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note<br />

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)<br />
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right<br />
I make a play fuckin' up your whole life<br />
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop<br />
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor<br />
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks<br />
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks, ayy<br />
This shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy<br />
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy<br />
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy<br />
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy<br />
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy<br />
